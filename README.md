# CPSC4610-AI-Checkers

Seattle University (SQ 2019)  
An implementation of the game of checkers with an AI player for the user to compete against.

Goal: Our goal is to create an intelligent AI that will rely on board state to determine the next best move and (Ideally) beat a human player. Utilizing algorithms learned throughout the course of CPSC4610, we will build the AI player to compete at the level of the user.
